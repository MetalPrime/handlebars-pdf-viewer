    "title" : "AIntelligent Systems Advisory Tool (iSAT), a next generation advisory tool for assisting farm management decision making in climate change adaptation ",
    "narrative": "The Intelligent Systems Advisory Tool (iSAT) is a digital tool embedded with configurable decision tree (DT) logic. The embedded DT logic can be configured to automate the generation of location and crop specific advisories which for farmers are a huge improvement over generic advisories which are not specific to their location or crop. The configuration of the DT logic is based on a process that blends crop simulation modelling, data analytics, farmer group discussions (FGD)",
    "innovationImportance": "The iSAT is developed to respond to key functions: • Enhance climate risk management • Support agricultural adaptation planning • Foster knowledge exchange for climate adaptation • Enhanced economic stability through climate-smart farmingiSAT is tailored to the local context reaching +80K people using IVR and radio dissemination",

    "beneficiariesNarrative" : "Droughts have become more frequent and severe across East Africa, exacerbating food insecurity, water scarcity, and economic instability. To address these challenges, robust drought monitoring and early warning systems must be developed, as well as anticipatory actions that can mitigate the impact of droughts before they occur. ICPAC, in collaboration with AICCRA and national governments are supporting the development of a National Drought Watch System across EA, to provide real-time data and analysis on drought conditions and",
