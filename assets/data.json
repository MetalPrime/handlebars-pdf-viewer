    "title" : "AIntelligent Systems Advisory Tool (iSAT), a next generation advisory tool for assisting farm management decision making in climate change adaptation ",
    "narrative": "The Intelligent Systems Advisory Tool (iSAT) is a digital tool embedded with configurable decision tree (DT) logic. The embedded DT logic can be configured to automate the generation of location and crop specific advisories which for farmers are a huge improvement over generic advisories which are not specific to their location or crop. The configuration of the DT logic is based on a process that blends crop simulation modelling, data analytics, farmer group discussions (FGD)",
    "innovationImportance": "The iSAT is developed to respond to key functions: • Enhance climate risk management • Support agricultural adaptation planning • Foster knowledge exchange for climate adaptation • Enhanced economic stability through climate-smart farmingiSAT is tailored to the local context reaching +80K people using IVR and radio dissemination",
